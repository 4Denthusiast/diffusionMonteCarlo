# Diffusion Monte Carlo
A DMC quantum-chemistry simulation, probably just for systems of up to 2 electrons (e.g. H, H2, H-, He). I'm making this partially to learn how the method works, but mostly so that I can get 4D chemistry results because for some reason all the existing research I've seen it about 3D. Maybe I should some up with an actual title for this program now it's public, oh well.

Results and a general explanation of the method can be found [here](https://blog.4denthusiast.net/diffusion-monte-carlo/).
